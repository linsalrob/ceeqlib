# Example Data

This is example sequence data from our favorite organism *Salmonella enterica* serovar LK5 and you are welcome to use it as is or do anything you like with it!

The left.fastq and right.fastq files are for testing pairing reads. There are 250 sequences in the left file and 75 sequences in the right file. Of the sequences in the right file, 50 should be the same as the left file.

The small.fastq and small.fastq.gz files are for testing reading/writing fastq. There are five sequences in the small.fastq file, and the same five sequences in the gzip version, small.fastq.gz. The only difference, of course, is that the second file is compressed using gzip so we can test libz.
