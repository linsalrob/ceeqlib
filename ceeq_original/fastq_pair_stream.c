/*
 * A streaming version of fastq pair. This uses slightly less than 1/3 the space of the previous version.
 *
 * Essentially, we have two improvements:
 * 	1. We add a flag to the struct fastq to tell whether it has been printed already, so we only need an additional int there
 * 	2. We only store the sequence information from the first file, and stream the information from the second file.
 *
 * We could also save more memory by only storing the IDs from the first file, but that would require two passes through that file.
